Here is the list of inputs:
OPTIONS jobs 3
OPTIONS queues 3
OPTIONS allotments for queue  2 is   1
OPTIONS quantum length for queue  2 is   3
OPTIONS allotments for queue  1 is   1
OPTIONS quantum length for queue  1 is   1
OPTIONS allotments for queue  0 is   1
OPTIONS quantum length for queue  0 is   1
OPTIONS boost 0
OPTIONS ioTime 5
OPTIONS stayAfterIO True
OPTIONS iobump True


For each job, three defining characteristics are given:
  startTime : at what time does the job enter the system
  runTime   : the total CPU time needed by the job to finish
  ioFreq    : every ioFreq time units, the job issues an I/O
              (the I/O takes ioTime units to complete)

Job List:
  Job  0: startTime   0 - runTime  30 - ioFreq   0
  Job  1: startTime   0 - runTime   8 - ioFreq   2
  Job  2: startTime  10 - runTime  12 - ioFreq   0
